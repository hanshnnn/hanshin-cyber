## What is endpoint hardening

For every organisation, especially with vast networks and employees with remote devices, endpoint hardening is crucial to protect these devices.

It involves configuring settings to comply with industry standards like [Microsoft security baseline](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/operating-system-security/device-management/windows-security-configuration-framework/windows-security-baselines) or the [CIS benchmarks](https://www.cisecurity.org/benchmark/microsoft_windows_desktop), these settings will ‚Äúharden‚Äù the remote devices in a company‚Äôs network. These endpoints, if not properly protected, often become easy target for cybercriminals to exploit the entire network

## What is the process like

Effective endpoint management and hardening involves implementing security measures according to the organization‚Äôs nature, as different businesses require different safety precautions.

It involves measures like firewalls, antivirus software, password configuration, etc. For example, disabling unnecessary services and restricting administrative access are effective in hardening network endpoints. 

## ü•ÖThe goal of it!

{{< callout type="info" >}}
    reduce the attack surface of an endpoint, making it more difficult for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities and gain unauthorized access to the device or network.

Categories of endpoint hardening include:

- **Security controls** - antivirus and anti-malware software, endpoint detection and response (EDR), firewalls
- **Device protection** - patch management, endpoint protection platform, application whitelisting
- **Vulnerability management** - ****vulnerability scanning, operation system hardening, application hardening

Why do we need endpoint security

As mentioned, endpoints are easily targeted as entry points into the company network assets.

The variety of systems and devices (including Windows, MacOS and Linux) increased the complexity of standardising security policies. Hence it becomes more crucial for IT to employ the right mix of endpoint security tools and strategies tailored to their environment.

Some benefits include:

- **improve security** - enforcing least privilege and managing vulnerabilities reduces threat surfaces
- **enhance endpoint performance -** hardened devices have fewer misconfiguration and incompatibilities that potentially cause disruptions
- **compliance and auditability -** ensuring proper controls like session monitoring and management will provide comprehensive and instant reporting when needed

## Weak üÜö Hard Endpoints

What are weak endpoints looking like?

‚ùå outdated software

‚ùå weak passwords

‚ùå escalated access

‚ùå bloated and unnecessary service packages

These weak endpoints will give opportunities for attackers to:

- install malware and ransomware that is effective against known vulnerabilities
- use factory-set credentials
- search for open ports or disabled security features

## Conclusion

Endpoint Hardening is crucial for a more secure network environment by configuring the right security measures.
