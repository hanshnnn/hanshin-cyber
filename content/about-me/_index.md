Hi, Iâ€™m a final-year cybersecurity student with a strong passion for building a safer digital world. &nbsp;<br class="sm:hx-block hx-hidden" />

This website is a journal of my personal journey into cybersecurityâ€”a space where I document the skills Iâ€™m developing, the challenges Iâ€™m tackling, and the lessons Iâ€™m learning along the way.

  ðŸ’¡ Inspiration Behind
{{< /hextra/hero-section >}}

While university gave me a starting point, I quickly realized that the curriculum alone wasnâ€™t enough to prepare for real-world cybersecurity field. That realization led me to take initiativeâ€”diving deep into self-learning, participating in CTF competitions, and building real-world projects to sharpen my skills.

My goal is to become a cybersecurity leader, and this portfolio reflects the steps Iâ€™m taking to get there.
